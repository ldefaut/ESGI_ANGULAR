# KanbanFire

## Student Name: [Louis DEFAUT] 
I had never created any project with angular before this week

## Hosting
The project is hosted on [Firebase](https://angular-fire-fb11e.web.app/)

## I18n
The project is available in English and French.
I started to use the i18n module but I didn't succeed to make the switcher. So after 3 hours 
trying, I change to use the ngx-translate module. I didn't have time to translate all the fields 
in my app.

## Project Description

This project is a Kanban board. It is a tool that helps visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It uses cards to represent work items and columns to represent each step of the process. The Kanban board is a pull system that balances demands with available capacity. It is a visual management system that helps you maximize efficiency (or flow).
